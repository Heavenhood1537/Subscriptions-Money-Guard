SUBSCRIPTION MONEY GUARD

A simple one‑page checklist that helps families and helpers find and stop wasted subscription and bill payments—especially for retirees.

Most households pay for subscriptions and services they no longer use. Subscriptions Money Guard gives you an easy printable or online checklist to review internet, phone, TV, streaming, insurance, car payments, food deliveries, and more in one place. Fill it out together with your family or other helper once, mark “keep” or “cancel later,” and see how much money you can save each month.
